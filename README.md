**A modern, web-based astrocartography tool for curious minds.** Plot a natal
chart's planetary lines on an interactive world map and drag to relocate with the
chart wheel updating live. It features planet-to-planet parans and local space,
eight house systems, geodetic (Mundane) lines, time overlays (transits, secondary
progressions, solar-arc and primary directions) with an animated timeline, and
synastry. Every position is computed client-side with the Swiss Ephemeris. Runs
on any device, no install.

Deployed as a static site on Cloudflare Pages, with two edge functions for
geocoding.

<!-- TEMP: accuracy disclaimer. Remove once outputs are corroborated against other tools. -->
> **⚠️ Early access: accuracy is still being verified.** AstroLina
> uses the same astronomical datasets as the professional tools (Swiss Ephemeris
> / JPL DE441), but its output is still being cross-checked against established
> software, and display bugs could currently misplace a line or other element.
> Until this note is removed, please treat the results as provisional and
> double-check anything important against a tool you already trust.

## Features

- **Astrocartography lines** for the ten classical planets plus the lunar nodes,
  Black Moon Lilith, Chiron, and the four main asteroids: MC / IC / ASC / DSC,
  color-coded per body and dashed per angle, each with its zenith point.
- **Parans** (planet-to-planet, meridian and horizon) and **local-space** lines,
  toggleable.
- **Time overlays** in one slot: transits, secondary progressions, solar-arc
  directions, and primary directions, with a date scrubber and play/pause
  animation that sweeps the lines across the map over time.
- **Relationship mapping**: overlay a second chart (synastry), with a bi-wheel and
  natal-to-overlay cross-aspects.
- **Live relocation**: hover or pin anywhere on the map; the relocated angles and
  chart wheel update in real time. Pin your natal location, or recenter the map
  on the active pin.
- **Relocated chart wheel**: a compact wheel beside the map, plus an expandable
  detailed view with an Advanced mode (degree · sign · minute readouts and the
  aspect grid). Eight house systems: Placidus (default), Koch, Regiomontanus,
  Campanus, Porphyry, Alcabitus, Whole Sign, Equal.
- **Calculation conventions** as live toggles: Celestial vs geodetic (Mundane)
  line placement, In Mundo vs In Zodiaco, house system, lunar-node type
  (mean/true), and the progression/direction method.
- **Chart library**: store multiple charts (localStorage), switch between them,
  edit, and delete.
- **Birthplace geocoding + timezone resolution**: search any place, offline-first
  from a bundled GeoNames dataset with an OpenStreetMap fallback, with
  historical-DST handling and an "uncertain" flag for pre-1970 births outside the
  Americas or Europe.
- **Import**: paste an AstroDataBank-style text block or a comma-delimited export,
  or drop a `.txt` / `.csv`, to add charts in bulk.
- **Flat or globe** map projection, and **three basemap themes** (Earth, Glass,
  Dark).

## Tech stack

- **Vite + React + TypeScript**
- **MapLibre GL** rendering **OpenFreeMap** vector basemaps (OpenMapTiles schema,
  OpenStreetMap data); the "Earth" theme uses a self-hosted **MapTiler Basic**
  style (BSD-3-Clause)
- **Swiss Ephemeris** (`@swisseph/browser`, WebAssembly, AGPL-3.0) for all body
  positions, houses, and sidereal time, client-side, with self-hosted `.se1`
  data in `public/ephe/`
- **tz-lookup** + **luxon** for timezone/offset resolution
- **Cloudflare Pages** hosting; two **Pages Functions** (`/api/geocode` and
  `/api/reverse-geocode`) proxy and edge-cache OpenStreetMap's Nominatim
- **Noto Sans Symbols** (subset, **SIL Open Font License 1.1**) for the
  astrological glyphs; license + attribution in
  [`public/fonts/`](public/fonts/) (shipped to `dist/fonts/OFL.txt`)

## Getting started

Requires Node 24 LTS (see `.nvmrc`). Node 22.12+ also works; Node 20 is
end-of-life.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev        # Vite dev server (http://localhost:5173)
```

In dev, `/api/geocode` and `/api/reverse-geocode` are served by Vite middleware
(see `vite.config.ts`) so search and reverse-geocoding work the same as in
production.

### Build & preview

```bash
npm run build      # tsc -b + vite build  → dist/
npm run preview    # preview the built static site (no functions)
```

To preview exactly as Cloudflare serves it (static assets and the `functions/`
directory), use Wrangler:

```bash
npm run build
npx wrangler pages dev dist     # serves dist/ + runs the API functions for real
```

### Deploy

```bash
npm run deploy     # npm run build && wrangler pages deploy dist --project-name astrolina
```

`wrangler pages deploy` automatically discovers the `functions/` directory at the
project root and bundles it with the upload; no separate Worker deploy is needed.
The deploy output should mention compiling/uploading a Functions bundle.

Under an additional term permitted by AGPL section 7(b), any copy, modified

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Please read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md); merging
a contribution requires agreeing to the [Contributor License Agreement](CLA.md)
(you keep your copyright and grant AstroLina a broad license, including the right
to relicense the project in the future).

## Notes

- **Geocoder contact:** Nominatim's usage policy asks for an identifying
  `User-Agent` with a real contact. The default lives in
  `functions/_shared/geocodeSource.ts`; **if you self-host or fork this, set your
  own** via the `GEOCODER_UA` environment variable (on your Cloudflare Pages
  project, and locally for dev) so rate-limiting or abuse reports reach you, not
  the upstream contact. For heavy traffic, self-host Nominatim or use a paid
  provider.
- **Accuracy & scope:** what the app computes, where its accuracy has limits, and
  its data sources and licensing are in [`docs/about.md`](docs/about.md); the
  calculation conventions (ephemeris, lines, parans, house cusps, geodetic,
  directions) are in
  [`docs/calculation-methods.md`](docs/calculation-methods.md).
