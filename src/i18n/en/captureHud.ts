    // frame itself is the wrong shape or size, so the way out is a different ratio, a
    // bigger window, or the list. A card is held to a higher bar than the panel beside a
    // map: it draws the full chart — the aspect web, and the second ring of a running
    // overlay — and those stop fitting well before the wheel merely gets small.
    tooSmallCardHint:
      'This frame can’t give the wheel the room a full chart needs — the aspects and the overlay ring want more width than there is here, and a wide, shallow frame leaves a wheel almost no height at all. Choose 1:1 or 4:5, make the window bigger, turn Balance off to give the wheel its room back, or capture the positions as a List instead.',
