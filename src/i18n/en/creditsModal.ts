      'This app began as her practice, and it still answers to it. The methods it follows, the conventions it holds to, and the judgement behind every line it draws are hers — explained patiently, and often more than once, until the software matched the craft.',
    othersHeading: 'With thanks also to',
    body: 'Two professional astrologers gave their time, their expertise, and a great deal of patience to this project — answering questions, checking conventions, and helping an early tool find its footing. It would be a lesser thing without them.',

  // The invitation to report a problem, at the top of the dialog. Not a countdown to
  // its own removal: the ephemeris side is settled and says so, and what is young is
  // the software around it — where a reader's report is the fastest route to a fix.
  // Split in three so the opening sentence can carry the emphasis and the closing one
  // can be the link. A downstream build's help page can render lead + body under a
  // heading of its own rather than keeping a second copy of the wording, and point
  // `report` at itself instead of at the address (see creditsFooter's notice tail).
