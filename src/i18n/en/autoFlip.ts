// The auto-flip notice — shown when an action rewrote a setting the user hadn't
// asked about. Short on purpose: the full reasoning belongs on the setting's own hover
// tip, which is still there tomorrow, whereas this card is gone in two seconds. Say
// what moved and the one fact that makes it follow, then stop.
//
// Where the control LIVES is a separate question, and the answer depends on whether the
// card can point at it. When a kind's target is on screen the card anchors beside it and
// rings it — so a sentence describing where it sits is spent narrating something the
// reader is already looking at. Those kinds name the control in its OWN words instead
// (the segment labels, the option names), which still locates it for a screen reader,
// where the ring is no help at all. The kinds that CANNOT anchor — no target, or one
// behind a panel that may well be shut — keep the plain "it lives in X", because for
// them it is the only route back.
//
// So the copy is coupled to AUTO_FLIP_META[kind].target: give a kind a target that is
// only sometimes rendered and its body needs the location clause back.
export const autoFlip = {
  suppress: 'Don’t show me again',
  ok: 'Got it',

  // Always anchored, and to BOTH of the controls it names — the chip in the timeline nub
  // and the frame segments in the returns row (see AUTO_FLIP_META). So no location clause:
  // the title names the setting and the value it moved to, which is what a screen reader
  // needs, and the two rings do the rest for everyone else.
  //
  // That is also why the last sentence can afford to say "the ✕ on the chip" without
  // explaining where the chip is. It could not before the card learned to clear more than
  // one control: it used to come to rest squarely on the chip, hiding the ✕ in the same
  // breath as naming it.
  //
  // The first two sentences describe the frame the reader is NOW in. An earlier draft opened
  // on the one they are NOT in ("on Natal angles its lines would…") and read as a
  // non-sequitur — the card announces one frame and then talks about somewhere else, so the
  // reader has to hold a counterfactual before they have been told what they actually got.
  // The reason still turns on the alternative, so it is IMPLIED ("the only frame its lines
  // move in") rather than narrated; the comparison belongs on the two segments' own tips.
  //
  // The LAST sentence is the one this card exists for, and it is the same sentence
  // 'line-system-held' ends on: nothing was taken. It also names what gives it back, because
  // the chip carrying that handle is small and new, and a reader who has just watched every
  // line on the map move is not in a mood to go looking.
  'overlay-frame-held': {
    title: 'Overlay frame held on Return angles',
    body: 'A return chart is a moment of its own, with its own angles, and the map is now drawn against them rather than the natal ones. The previous frame is held, not cleared — it comes back on leaving the return, or straight away from the ✕ on the chip.',
  },
  // Fires from several tools, so the trigger stays unnamed — but the old "has no meaning
  // under the Mundane mapping" asserted the conclusion without the fact behind it. The
  // location stays: this points into the Calculation panel, which is often shut.
  'line-system': {
    title: 'Line system set to Celestial',
    body: 'Mundane maps the tropical zodiac onto Earth’s longitudes, so it carries no sidereal time — and what you just opened needs it. The line system lives in Calculation.',
  },
  // The map changes exactly as it does above, but nothing was taken — so the sentence
  // that matters here is the one about getting it back, not the one about what moved.
  'line-system-held': {
    title: 'Mundane is on hold',
    body: 'Mundane maps the tropical zodiac onto Earth’s longitudes, so there is no sidereal version of it to draw. Your choice is held, not cleared — set the zodiac back to Tropical and it returns.',
  },
  // No target at all — it is reopened from a menu — so this card never anchors and never
  // rings anything. The last sentence is the reader's only route back; don't strip it by
  // analogy with 'overlay-frame' above, which can afford to drop it precisely because it
  // is pointing at the thing.
  'local-space-off': {
    title: 'Local space closed',
    body: 'The Mundane mapping is time-independent, and local space is built from the birth moment. Reopen it from the View menu.',

  // Not a change — a difference. Worth saying plainly, because the reader's first
  // encounter with it is usually a set of lines that don't match the program they came
  // from, and "this app is wrong" is the reasonable conclusion from that evidence.
  // Kept short: it lands unasked-for, and the reader is here to look at their map. It
  // does say what the two readings DO differently, though — without that the sentence
  // asks to be taken on trust, which is exactly what the reader is already unwilling to
  // do. How far they diverge (Pluto ~17°, the Moon ~5°) still belongs in the control's
  // own hint and in Help, not in a card that will be gone in five seconds.
  //
  // Framed as two ways of answering one question rather than as us-versus-them. The
  // earlier draft opened "Most other programs default to In Zodiaco", which puts the
  // reader's own software on one side of a disagreement in the first four words — and
  // the words available for the other side ("true", "actual") all imply the program
  // they trust is wrong. It isn't; it answers a different question. Nothing here ranks
  // the two, which also leaves the reader free to switch without conceding anything.
  //
  // The two branches get one short sentence each, both NAMED. An earlier draft ran them
  // together and named only In Zodiaco, which left the reader holding two options and one
  // label and no way to tell which was which — while the title, the only place In Mundo
  // appeared, says which is ON without saying what it means. And "latitude and all" is
  // load-bearing rather than decorative: it is what "flattens" flattens, so the pair only
  // clicks if the first sentence has already put the latitude there.
  //
  // TRIMMED (2026-08-07) by two sentences that had each been argued for above and no longer
  // earn their place on a card the reader did not ask for:
  //   - "the usual default elsewhere, and usually why lines here differ from a map you
  //     already know" — a reader told there are two ways to place a body, while looking at
  //     a map that doesn't match the one they know, draws that line themselves. Stating it
  //     spends the card's last sentence on the reader's own next thought.
  //   - "Line projection switches between them" — this named the control instead of
  //     pointing at it, on the reasoning that the ring is no help to a screen reader. That
  //     reasoning was about LOCATING the control, and it doesn't survive this kind's single
  //     trigger: the card only ever fires on opening the panel the control lives in, so the
  //     reader is already in it. (Restore the clause if the trigger is ever widened.)
  // What is left is the one thing a reader can't infer: what the two readings DO
  // differently. The magnitudes (Pluto ~17°, the Moon ~5°) stay on the control's own hint
  // and in Help, where they are still there next week.
  'line-projection': {
    title: 'These lines are drawn In Mundo',
