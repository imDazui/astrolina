// Left-dock width registry. `--es-width` on <html> tells the whole chrome how
// much of the LEFT edge is covered by a docked panel — the map edge-glow insets
// by it, flyTo centering and the floating HUDs shift by it, and the top bars
// re-center around it. Historically the expanded chart sidebar wrote the var
// directly; any second docked panel would then collide (last writer wins, and
// either panel's unmount reset the var to 0 under the other). This registry
// makes publishing safe for ANY number of docked panels: each publishes its own
// width under a stable id, and the var carries the MAX (every publisher is
// left-anchored, so content must clear the widest). Empty registry → 0px.
//
// A publisher may additionally RESERVE its width (`{ reserve: true }`): rather
// than overlaying the map, it asks the map canvas itself to shrink out from
// under it — its own dedicated column, the left-edge counterpart of the reserved
// bottom band (lib/bottomDock.ts). Like that band, the map takes the reserved
// inset as a PROP, not by reading a var (an inline style commits before layout
// effects, so the map's resize always measures the final size; a var write from
// a sibling's effect can land after the map already resized). So the reserved
// max is exposed through a subscribe hook a host reads into React state and
// passes down. Panels that only shift the chrome (the default, no reserve)
// leave the map full-width and simply overlay it.

// TRUE remaining centre; see the `50% + --es-width/4 + --es-reserved/4` rules).
