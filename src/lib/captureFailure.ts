/* Why the last `captureFrame` handed back nothing.
 *
 * captureFrame's contract is `Promise<Blob | null>`, and three unrelated consumers hold it:
 * App, the Capture window, and any registered captureSink. Widening it to a result union
 * would touch all three for a string only one of them ever displays — so the reason is left
 * here instead, for that one to pick up beside the null it already handles.
 *
 * It lives in lib rather than in Map.tsx for the same reason captureGate and captureBrand do:
 * a component module that also exports functions loses fast refresh for the whole file.
 *
 * The point of it is that the banner can only ever say "try again". A blocked tile source, a
 * browser that refused a 2D context and an encoder rejecting an oversized bitmap were
 * indistinguishable to the user AND to whoever read their support mail — and "try again" is
 * the wrong advice for all three.
