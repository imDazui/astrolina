// Bottom-dock height registry — the bottom-edge sibling of lib/leftDock.ts.
// `--sky-band-h` on <html> tells the viewport-anchored bottom furniture (the
// edge glow, the docked overlay bars, the minimap, the info chip, the zoom-out
// pill, the movable-HUD clamp) how much of the bottom edge is a reserved
// layout band, so each shifts up by it. NOTE: the map canvas itself does NOT
// read this var — the map takes its inset as a prop (an inline style commits
// before layout effects, so its resize() always measures the final size; a
// var write from a sibling's effect can land after the map already resized).
// The published height is a band's TOTAL: on phones the sky band pads itself
// by the home-indicator inset and includes it here, so consumers combine the
// var with env(safe-area-inset-bottom) via max(), never by adding the two.
const heights = new Map<string, number>();
