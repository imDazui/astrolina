// ── THE SWITCH ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// The GEODETIC (Mundane) line system is held (2026-08-27) while discrepancies in
// how it draws are worked through. Nothing is deleted or stubbed: the generators,
// the settings control, the strings and the docs are all still here and still
// compiled, and this one boolean is the whole of the hold.
//
//   TO LIFT IT: set this to false — and delete the per-device unlock below with
//   it, along with its console command and its entry in the downstream build's
//   docs/hidden-features.md. That is the entire revert.
//
// What false restores:
//   · the Mundane half of Calculation ▸ Line system goes live instead of dimmed,
//   · a stored 'geodetic' preference stops being masked and draws again,
//   · the Help article drops its "under review" note.
//
// NOTHING IS WRITTEN. A reader who had Mundane selected keeps it in
// `astro:line-system:v1`; the derived `lineSystem` in App.tsx simply masks it to
// celestial for as long as the hold lasts, exactly as a sidereal zodiac does. The
// hold is a standing state, not an event, so it derives rather than rewrites —
// and when it ends, their choice is still there. (This is the rule the whole
// forced-settings discipline turns on; see vendor/core/docs/forced-settings.md.)
//
// WHY IT LIVES IN THE CORE. The setting, the derivation and the control are all
// here, and so is the code being reviewed — the open core draws the same geodetic
// map from the same generators. Holding it downstream only would leave the fault
// reachable in the build that carries it.

const HELD_BASE = true;

// The per-device escape hatch, so the hold can stay on for everyone while the
// mapping is under review and the people testing it can still get at it. Written
// ONLY by the downstream console's `geodetic` command; nothing in the UI touches
// it, and no boot path writes it — so the default stays reachable and the key
// never needs a `:v2` bump.
//
// LOCKING REMOVES THE KEY rather than writing a '0'. Once the base flag flips, the
// override is inert anyway (`false && …`), and a leftover '0' would sit in every
// device that ever used it, outliving the thing it once undid.
