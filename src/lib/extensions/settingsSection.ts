// Settings-sidebar section registry — the seam that lets a downstream build add an
// accordion SECTION to the settings sidebar (a 5th tab beyond Appearance / Map
// Filters / Calculation / Advanced) WITHOUT editing Sidebar.tsx. The core sections
// keep their own inline wiring; anything registered here renders IN ADDITION, beneath
// the built-ins.
//
// The settings twin of the Tools (./toolExtensions) and Overlay (./overlayExtensions)
// menu seams. Gating is SHARED with them via ./entitlement — one setEntitlementResolver
// call covers all three, so a gated section can't silently fall open. The open core
// registers nothing (the registry is empty, so the render path is a no-op here).
