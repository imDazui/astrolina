// The sky band's TRACK slot — a single-slot seam (like profileSection) letting a
// downstream build supply the band's expandable center section (a richer
// visualization of the day's events) without editing the band. The open core
// ships no track: its band is the compact legend + controls row. The slot's
// toggle renders in the band's control column only when a track is registered
// AND entitled (the shared entitlement resolver; NO teaser — un-entitled users
// simply don't see it), carrying the gated-tier tag in its hover tip.
