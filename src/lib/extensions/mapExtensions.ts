// Map-HUD extension registry — the seam that lets a feature attach a View-menu
// toggle and a floating HUD WITHOUT editing App.tsx or TopNav.tsx. Core features
// keep their own inline wiring; anything registered here is rendered IN ADDITION.
//
// This is the attach point for a downstream build that depends on this open
// core: such a feature is a folder that calls registerMapExtension({...}) at
// startup and ships its own HUD + label, touching no core file. Gating is built
// in: a 'gated' extension renders its HUD only when entitled — the menu hides it
// otherwise (no teaser). The open core ships no gating (every extension resolves to
// entitled).
