// An optional gate on the Capture EXPORT actions (Download / Copy / Share). The open core
// ships none — export is always free — so the buttons behave exactly as before. A downstream
// build can install one to make export an account/paid feature, the
// same way it installs the brand + plan resolvers (no core file touched). Kept product-neutral:
// the core only asks "is export locked right now?" and, when a locked user taps an export,
// "do the locked thing" (e.g. open an upsell). The policy + any UI live downstream.
//
// `isLocked` runs in the render path AND on click, so keep it synchronous and cheap (read a
// value the downstream already holds — a plan flag — never a fetch). When it returns true the
// CaptureHud marks the three export buttons with the Advanced (ADV) tip tag and diverts their
// taps to onLocked instead of exporting.
