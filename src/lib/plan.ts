// The plan / subscription tier ladder as ONE source of truth, so the open-core "Advanced"
// gating and the downstream paid gating are two rungs of a single mechanism rather than
// parallel concepts. A feature declares the tier it BELONGS to; the menu badge and the
// visibility rules read from here, so adding a downstream feature is just `tier: 'gated'` —
// it inherits the badge + gating with no new wiring.
//
//   • new   — the baseline every user has.
//   • adv   — Advanced reading mode: OPEN-SOURCE, a free toggle (advancedWheel). Its
//             features (Slide, Local Space, Synastry, Eclipses, the Advanced settings tab)
//             are HIDDEN until the user opts in — no upsell, just more depth once enabled.
//   • gated — the DOWNSTREAM tier: a private build's extra Tools / Overlay / View options +
//             the 5th settings tab, added through the extension seams and gated by the
//             entitlement resolver (./extensions/entitlement). Gated the SAME way as adv —
//             HIDDEN until the tier is reached, no teaser. The core names this rung only
//             generically ('gated'); its user-facing label + final accent come downstream.
//
// Why a ladder and not booleans: the product is a subscription tier you climb — once a user
// opts into ADV they rarely go back (it only adds features), and the gated tier is the same
// step one rung higher. Both rungs gate identically (hidden until reached), so "is this
// unlocked?" is a single `tierMet` comparison and a downstream build slots its tier in
// without touching the core mechanism. (Core convention: name the paid rung 'gated', never
// by a product/plan name — that lives downstream.)
