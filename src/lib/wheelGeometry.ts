// How a chart wheel spends its radius.
//
// Pulled out of WheelSvg, which derived every ring by subtracting fixed pixel
// constants from size/2. Those constants were cut for a ~700px desktop wheel, and
// on a phone their sum exceeds the whole radius — so the bands nearest the centre
// absorbed the shortfall and the wheel quietly fell apart from the inside out:
//
//   382px, Advanced on   aspect hub 12px (6.3% of the radius), and 12.6px of arc
//                        per house number
//   340px, Advanced on   the house band down to a 3px hairline
//   280px, Advanced off  houseBand reaches 0, so the house ring, the cusp lines
//                        and all twelve house numbers vanish with nothing said
//
// None of that was decided. It fell out of the arithmetic, which is the reason
// this is a module with a test rather than a block of subtractions: the bands are
// SHARES of the radius with pixel floors and caps, and when they still do not fit,
// detail is shed in a DECLARED order until the centre gets its due. A wheel that
// has to drop something now drops what was chosen in advance, and reports which.
//
// Everything here is pure arithmetic on a pixel size — no React, no DOM, no
// ephemeris — so the renderer and scripts/verify-wheel-bands.ts call THIS function
// rather than each keeping its own copy of the figures. That is the point:
// verify-wheel-layout.ts used to restate the radii by hand, with `advanced` pinned
// false and the readout tier pinned to 440px, which is exactly why it never saw a
// single one of the failures above.

/** The size at which the readout is offered without being asked for. Unchanged in
 *  spirit from the old READOUT_MIN (440), but lowered and demoted to an OFFER:
 *  whether the trio is actually drawn — and how much of it — is the hub check's
 *  answer below, not this constant's.
 *
 *  330 rather than a phone's ~380: the offer is only the start of the ladder, so a
 *  wheel that cannot afford the whole trio drops to degree·sign and then to degree
 *  alone instead of falling off a cliff at one threshold. It has to sit below the
 *  smallest phone we care about — an iPhone SE gives the wheel ~367px — because a

//
// 0.16, not the 0.30 this started at. The aspect figure needs a circle it can be read
// on, and past that the middle is simply empty: a hub at 0.30 was holding radius that
// the per-body coordinates needed more, and the coordinates were the thing actually

  //   1. the trio has to read as part of the BODY, not as a row of numbers floating
  //      between two rings;
  //   2. every px the trio moves INWARD costs it tangential room. Circumference
  //      shrinks with radius, so the same "28°" needs a wider ANGLE the further in it

  //      "give the coordinates room" makes neighbouring bodies collide sooner, which

  //
  //      What happens THERE has changed, and the change is worth knowing before

  //      seat what fell into them at any pressure — they fell through to even
  //      spacing and every glyph in them lost its notch, which is what a 340px wheel

  // This is the COMFORTABLE figure, and it is the only figure stated here: what an
  // arc that cannot seat what fell into it does with it belongs to placeOnRing, not
  // to the budget. It gives this up FIRST, and all of it, before the glyph discs
  // give anything — crowding the coordinates costs a reader a moment, moving a glyph
  // off its notch costs them the position. So do not fold a tolerance in here: the
  // number to state is the one a chart with room actually gets.
  //
  // Worth knowing which of the two actually binds, because it is not the obvious
  // one: measured across every shipped size, THIS floor exceeds the disc
  // requirement. At 380px it asks 17.2° where the discs ask 12.0°, so it is the
  // coordinates, not the glyphs, that decide how far a stellium fans. Squeezing the
  // glyphs while holding this at its full figure would move nothing at all.
