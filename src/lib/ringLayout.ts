// Laying marks out around a ring without them landing on top of each other.
//
// Pulled out of WheelSvg once it stopped being a one-line "push the next one
// along" and grew the parts that are easy to get subtly wrong — a circular seam, a
// satisfiability limit, marks of unequal width, and marks that are not allowed to
// move at all. None of it touches React or the DOM, so it is checkable on its own:
// see scripts/verify-wheel-layout.ts, which asserts the invariants that matter
// (nothing overlaps; a fixed mark keeps its exact spot unless the ring genuinely
// cannot hold the set).
//
// Everything here works in DEGREES round the ring, with widths in PIXELS at the
// radius the marks are drawn on — the two are only ever mixed through arcDeg.

// Arc in DEGREES subtended by `px` at `radius` — the one conversion every
// separation figure is expressed through, so a clearance is stated in the pixels
// it actually has to clear rather than in a degree figure whose meaning changes
// with the ring it lands on.

// Relax SORTED ring offsets (degrees, ascending in [0,360)) so neighbours sit at
// least `sep` apart, treating the ring as CIRCULAR: a 1°-wide pair straddling
// the 0°/360° seam (bodies conjunct on either side of the ASC) is 1° apart, not
// 359°. A linear pass can't see that — and worse, it can push a near-360
// cluster past 360 into an untouched body just after 0. So the pass runs in a
// frame rotated to start just after the LARGEST circular gap (whose two ends
// are the only neighbours guaranteed already clear), then maps back mod 360.

/** How much of their combined width two BODY marks may share before the layout
 *  calls it a collision — 0 for none (every mark fully clear of its neighbours),
 *  a quarter for the default here.
 *
 *  Separation is not free: every degree a body is pushed off its true longitude is
 *  a degree it is drawn away from where it actually is, and past ~15° of push a
 *  planet in the last degrees of one house is drawn inside the NEXT one. That is a
 *  worse lie than a clipped glyph. Astrological glyphs survive being partly covered
 *  better than most type does — ♃ and ♄ do not become each other — so some of that
 *  room is better spent on staying in the right house.
 *
 *  A THIRD was the first figure, and it was too much to look at. Lowering it is not
 *  free either, and the exchange rate is shallow enough that the choice is genuinely
 *  about the eye rather than about the numbers — over the 5,000-chart realistic
 *  sweep, charts with a body drawn past a whole sign:
 *
 *      1/3  -> 199        0.28 -> 219        0.22 -> 229
 *      0.30 -> 209        1/4  -> 229        0.20 -> 249
 *
 *  so a quarter costs 30 charts in 5,000, 0.6%, against a deepest overlap that goes
 *  from a third of a glyph to a quarter of one. Below about a fifth the cost starts
 *  climbing faster than the picture improves.
 *
 *  What the ceiling actually looks like, at a quarter, over the same sweep — and it
 *  is worth reading the second column, because the first deliberately includes
 *  19-body charts and 340px wheels, which are crowded by construction:
 *
 *                        all charts    ten bodies, 440px+
 *      no contact           89.2%            98.2%
 *      up to  5%             1.7%             0.5%
 *      up to 10%             1.6%             0.4%
 *      up to 15%             1.6%             0.4%
 *      up to 20%             1.6%             0.3%
 *      up to 25%             4.3%             0.2%
 *
 *  The pile-up in the last row is the ceiling doing its job: those are the charts
 *  that wanted to go deeper and were stopped, and they are the ones where the
 *  alternative was a planet drawn in the wrong house.
 *
 *  It applies to BODY↔BODY pairs only. An angle code (As/Ds/Mc/Ic/Vx/Avx) is drawn
 *  with a panel-coloured halo that ERASES what it lands on rather than blending
 *  with it, so a code overlapping anything deletes the thing rather than crowding
 *  it — codes keep their full clearance. */

/** How far a body may be pushed off its true longitude before the layout spends
 *  the tolerance above rather than pushing it further.
 *
 *  This — not whether an arc can physically hold its marks — is what "tight" means
 *  here, and the difference decides the whole behaviour. Five bodies in one sign fit
 *  easily inside the 90° arc they live in, so by capacity nothing is tight; seating
 *  them all fully clear still fans them across 69° and puts a planet two houses from
 *  where it belongs. Capacity is about the arc. This is about the reader.
 *
 *  READ IT AS A CEILING, because that is what it is now. The arc solver below is
 *  exact, so on a crowded arc the worst push comes out AT this figure rather than
 *  somewhere under it: it is the furthest from its own notch any body is drawn on a
 *  chart the arc can serve at all. It did not mean that under the directional pass
 *  this replaced — there the search read its target off an intermediate layout that a
 *  later pass then improved, so the threshold bit early and the drawn result landed
 *  well inside it. Which is why the figure was re-measured against the solver rather
 *  than carried across with the number unchanged.
 *
 *  16° is measured, not chosen, and what the measurement says has changed with it.
 *  Over the 5,000-chart realistic sweep the count of charts with a body pushed past a
 *  WHOLE SIGN is 229 at EVERY threshold from 6° to 25° — down from 299 before, and
 *  now completely insensitive to this number. Where a body ends up in the wrong sign,
 *  no threshold was going to rescue it. So the threshold buys accuracy with one
 *  currency only:
 *
 *      6°  -> 2107 charts with a pair sharing ink      16°  ->  350
 *     10°  -> 1129                                     18°  ->  260
 *     12°  ->  711                                     20°  ->  190
 *     14°  ->  470                                     25°  ->  170
 *
 *  How DEEP that sharing goes is BODY_OVERLAP_SHARE’s business, and the histogram is
 *  there; what matters here is that 16° is where the count stops falling usefully.
 *  The four degrees from 16° to 20° save 160 charts in 5,000 and cost every body on
 *  a crowded arc four more degrees of distance from the notch that says where it is.
 *  Half a sign is the other half of the argument: at 20° a body can be drawn
 *  two-thirds of a sign from its own tick.
 *
 *  One more thing the sweep says, and it is a warning rather than an argument. Below
 *  16° the resize check at the foot of verify-wheel-layout starts FAILING — 8.9° of
 *  movement for one pixel at 297→298px, where a ten-body chart cannot be seated at
 *  all and squeezing harder only changes which arrangement it settles into. A
 *  tighter ceiling is not simply a better one. */

 *     stacks it back on the mark it started from — the very failure the pass
 *     exists to prevent.
 *  2. It closes the SEAM. The forward pass anchors at the largest natural gap on
 *     the assumption that gap can absorb the pushing; when a dense cluster
 *     consumes more than it, the last mark wraps round onto the first. A backward
 *     pass from the seam, then a second forward pass, resolves that.
 *  3. It has a floor it can always land on: if the two passes still leave a pair

/** Lay movable marks out on a ring around FIXED ones.
 *
 *  The angle codes are the fixed set. They mark an axis — the exact spot where a
 *  line crosses the wheel — and a code nudged off that spot is telling the reader
 *  something false about where the axis is, so they hold their ground and the
 *  bodies flow around them. (Bodies have a tick on the zodiac band recording
 *  their true degree; the codes' equivalent is the axis itself, which is drawn.)
 *
 *  Fixed marks split the circle into arcs, and each arc is an independent 1-D
 *  problem with a wall at each end: push forward from the left wall, then pull
 *  back from the right one.
 *
 *  What that decomposition cannot do is move a body OUT of an arc, and at a polar
 *  latitude the Midheaven can close to within a couple of degrees of the
 *  Ascendant — leaving a sliver of an arc with a body trapped in it and nowhere
 *  for it to go. So the result is checked, and if any pair is still short the
 *  whole ring is re-laid with the codes taking their chances alongside the bodies.
 *  The codes lose their exact spot there, which is the lesser loss: in that chart
 *  no arrangement can give it to both of them anyway.
 *
 *  `minSep` is the floor every pair clears whatever their widths say. It carries
 *  the constraint from the OTHER rings these marks drive (the degree·sign·minute
 *  trio fans inward from here, and the same angle buys less arc further in).
 *
 *  Returns display offsets in degrees, keyed by name — fixed marks included, so

    // What that buys over the forward-then-backward pass it replaces is not

    // pressing on each other back toward its members’ mean. The second pass could
    // not UNPOOL. A mark the first pass had nudged by a single degree joined the run
    // in front of it and then paid that run’s whole re-centring shift: measured on

    // relaxing the gaps only ever widens the feasible set, and this is a projection
    // onto it), but WHICH mark is furthest out changes, and the maximum can rise for
    // a stretch while the sum falls. Measured on a six-body arc at 348px, against a
    // 16° ceiling:
    //
    //     t     0.100  0.125  0.150  0.175  0.200

    // both answers inside the ceiling and nothing to choose between them.

    // So: walk down from full pressure and stop at the first rung that fails. The
    // answer is the shallowest pressure from which the ceiling holds AND KEEPS
    // HOLDING, which is monotone by construction. It moves by at most one rung when
    // the wheel moves by a pixel, and a rung is worth a fraction of a degree.
    // The walk runs all the way down every time, with no shortcut for the arc that
    // is already under the ceiling at rest. That shortcut was here and it was the
    // seam: taking t = 0 whenever t = 0 happened to pass is a SECOND rule, and where
    // the two meet — the ceiling met at rest and missed a rung above it — the answer
    // jumped between them. Measured at 398→399px on a six-body arc: 8°. One rule for
