// One capsule split into halves, exactly one of them lit — a segmented picker in a
// bubble, for a choice with two short answers and no third.
//
// It exists to buy vertical space: a radio list costs a row per option plus its
// explanation, this costs one row for the pair. That trade only works when the
// options are SHORT and the explanations can live on hover, so both are required
// here rather than optional. Where each option needs its visible own paragraph,
// use the sidebar's HintOption list instead.
//
// Built for a PAIR, which is why the halves divide the width equally. More works —
// the flex basis and the divider rule are count-agnostic — but a 200px sidebar
// runs out of room fast, so check the render before reaching for a third.
