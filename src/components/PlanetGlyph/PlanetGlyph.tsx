// Astrological planet glyph drawn from the bundled 'Noto Sans Symbols' font (via
// the `.astro-glyph` class). Two render modes, matching the call sites:
//   • DOM mode (no x/y): an inline <span> sized by `size` (font-size px); color
//     inherits from the parent unless `color` is given.
//   • SVG mode (x/y given): an SVG <text> centered on (x, y), for use inside the
//     chart wheel; `color` (default currentColor) sets the fill.
// SVG’s dominant-baseline="central" centres the FONT’s em box, not the mark drawn
// inside it — so a symbol whose ink is not centred in its own em box comes out
// off-centre by exactly that much, and inside the wheel's planet discs it shows.
// Every glyph is lifted by this fraction of its size to correct for it.
//
// Measured, two ways that agree to 0.003: canvas TextMetrics (ink
// actualBoundingBox* against the fontBoundingBox* that `central` centres) and
// pixels off a Chrome screenshot of this very markup. Across the nineteen glyphs
// the ink sits between 0.045 and 0.155 of the size below the em-box centre, and
// 0.10 is the middle of that — within 0.005 for most of them.
const GLYPH_LIFT = 0.1;

// The exceptions, and only where the eye can see them. ⊗ is a CIRCLE INSIDE A
// CIRCLE once it is drawn in a disc, and nothing shows a few pixels of offset like
// two circles that should be concentric — it read as sitting low, and it was, by
// 0.045 of its size after the flat lift. The reason is in glyphChars: this one
// character is bundled from a different Noto face (Math, not Symbols), where a
// mathematical operator is centred on the math axis rather than on the optical
// centre the symbol faces use.
//
// ♂ is further out still (0.055 low) and ♄ as far the other way (0.058 high), and
// neither is listed: an arrow and a scythe have no axis of symmetry for the eye to
// measure against, so the offset that is glaring on ⊗ is invisible on them.
// Centring by ink box is an approximation of optical centring, and it is only worth
// applying where the two agree.
